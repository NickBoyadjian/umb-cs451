3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Multiline Comment)
      I approached this problem by first drawing out the diagram and then coding it out. It was as simple as reading
      a slash followed by a star, then continuing reading until a star is found, and then only stop reading the comment
      if a slash is found after the star. I accomplished this with just a few lines of code and didn't have any problems.

   Problem 2 (Reserved Words)
      This part of the homework was probably the easiest. All I had to do was add the tokens to the tokeninfo file
      and then add them to the hash table stored in scanner.java. The only issue I had here was a typo but it was
      easy enough to spot after running a few tests.

   Problem 3 (Operators)
      This part of the homework was basically like homeowork 1. I started by adding the missing tokens, and then
      making the scanner able to read them. Because of all the practice I've already had with this from homework 1,
      this part of the homework wasn't really difficult, it was just tedious to add all the checks in the scanner.
      I didn't have any issues with this part of the assignment.

   Problem 4 (Literals)
      I approached this problem by first studying the appendix of the homework assignment. I needed to get a good idea
      about how doubles and longs were strictly defined. Adding the support for longs was my first step because I could
      see that it was the easiest of the two. After that, I attempted to figure out how to add the support for doubles which
      proved to be a bit complicated. I drew out the diagram, something I didn't feel I needed to do for longs. I was still
      a little confused but I broke  the problem into sub problems and simply solved the different scenarios one at a
      time. I had a bug where I was reading one to many characters after reading the double which made my program lose
      the next line of code. After going over my tokenized version with the correct one, I finally spotted the error and
      was able to figure out what part of the code was causing it.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

    No

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I think this assignment, especially the last part, made it very clear why we don't want to hand write the
   scanner. The code quickly becomes very messy and I can only imagine how tedious it would get when further adding
   new language features.
