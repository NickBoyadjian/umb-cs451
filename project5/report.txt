3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types):
   Like all the other homeworks, I started with the Long type first. Looking at the Int class,
   The analyze function for Longs just needed to change the type from Type.Int to Type.Long.

   The codegen method was where the real change needed to happen. The codegen for Ints basically
   checked for all the int constants and used the JVM Byte code for them. I looked for the
   Long versions and found that there were only LCONST_0 and LCONST_1. This meant that I
   could just use a simple if statement to handle the three cases. If my value was 0L or 1L,
   I would use the appropriate constant. Otherwise, I would use the addLDCInstruction method
   and simply pass it the parsed long.

   I noticed an error when I tried to compile the sample file that seemed to be stemming from the
   parseLong method. After testing out the method with some hard coded values, I realized that I
   needed to remove the 'l' from the end of the text string. After doing this, the error went away
   and I hit another road block.

   Now I was getting an error in regards to the method call. My first instinct was to check the
   JMethodDeclaration file which I didn't find anything. I ended up using piazza for this and I
   learned that I was supposed to have the type descriptor for longs to be J, and I had for some
   reason had them set to L. This now fixed my problem and I was able to compile the Literals test
   file. From here I went to test the BasicTypes file and had a whole new set of errors.

   I commented out the file and went about adding small pieces to see what would work and what wouldn't.
   One of the first things I tested was created double variables which wasn't working. I checked the
   JVariable class and saw where it was handling the offset loading of ints. I took this as a template
   and added the check for longs and doubles and then just changed the appropriate JVM byte code
   instruction. I could now declare variables of type double and long. Lastly I could see that I
   needed to extend all the operators to work with doubles and longs so I went ahead and extended all
   of them to do so.
